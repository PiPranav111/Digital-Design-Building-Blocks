# Fundamental Digital Design Building Blocks (Verilog)

This repository contains Verilog implementations of fundamental digital design blocks with behavioral and RTL models. Each block is verified through simulation waveforms and synthesis schematics using Vivado.

## Included Modules

- [JK Flip-Flop](./JK_FlipFlop)  
- [D Flip-Flop](./D_FlipFlop) *(coming soon)*   

## Learning Focus

- Understanding behavioral vs synthesizable RTL modeling
- Practical simulation and waveform analysis
- Hardware realization via synthesis and schematic visualization
- Industry-standard coding and documentation practices
